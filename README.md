## Project

This is a full-stack brochure web-site for a (fictional) company.

## Purchasing

Fictionally purchasing services of the company will result in an interaction with the backend, which will produce a response from the backend to be found in the browser development tools: Network > purchase > Response. For development information, much of the response will also be conveyed via a window alert.
