## Project

This is a full-stack brochure website for a (fictional) company.

## Transactions

Fictionally purchasing services of the company will result in an interaction with the backend, which will produce a response from the backend to be found in the browser development tools, as well as some information logged in the console. 

Fictional transactions are processed by Prettypay. Although it interacts with this brochure project, Prettypay is a separate project that can be found in its own directory within this parent directory and can also be placed in other projects. The Prettypay directory has its own README.md to explain the project.

Both this project and Prettypay record transactions. This brochure project records successful transactions in `/receipts/receipts.json`, with information on purchase items, quantities, etc.. Prettypay also records the amount, identity, time and outcome of all transactions it has processed, but is not concerned with items, quantities, etc.. Its records can be found in `/prettypay/records`.
